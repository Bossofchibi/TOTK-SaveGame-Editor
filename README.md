## Info

This is a very simple Savegame Editor!

I have no prior experience in python. This is just a small project to get familiar with the language.

**Make sure to backup your save before using the savegame editor**

## Features:

- Rupees
- Max Hearts
- Stamina

## Usage

- Click on `Open Savefile`
- Select your `progress.sav` in the file dialog
- Check if the Rupee and Heart ammount matches with your savefile
- Edit the values to your desired amounts
- Click on `Patch Savefile`

**A quick note on stamina:**

- 1000 = 1 Wheel
- 2000 = 2 Wheels
- 3000 = 3 Wheels

You can go above 3 wheels but they dont show in game

## Compatibility

This savegame editor has only been tested on Version 1.0.0.

Please be aware of this if you are using a different version of the game.
